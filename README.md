## Introduction

Blindness Detection is a machine learning-based project that focuses on developing an algorithm capable of detecting blindness in medical images. The system is trained using a dataset of medical images labeled with blindness annotations. By analyzing these images, the model can classify whether a given image exhibits signs of blindness or not.

## Installation

To run the Blindness Detection project locally, please follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gandharvk422/Blindness_Detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Blindness_Detection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the Blindness Detection system, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have installed all the dependencies as mentioned in the installation section.

2. Prepare your medical image dataset for testing. The dataset should be organized in a specific format, which is explained in the [Data](#data) section.

3. Run the detection script:
   ```
   python Blindness Detection.py --image happy.jpg
   ```

4. The system will process the image and display the results, indicating whether the image exhibits signs of blindness or not.

## Model

The Blindness Detection system is built using a deep learning model architecture, specifically tailored for image classification. The details of the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training process are explained in the code files and documentation within the repository.

## Results

The performance and results of the Blindness Detection system can be found in the repository's documentation. I have included detailed analysis and evaluation metrics to measure the accuracy and reliability of the model.
